# sh-gotty-console-nickramsay-dev

Simple [gotty](https://github.com/yudai/gotty) `busybox` docker container for my website [console.nickramsay.dev](https://console.nickramsay.dev). It comes with a persistent volume between client sessions. Note that the persistent volume is not space restricted which may pose security concerns.
